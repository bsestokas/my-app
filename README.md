# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.1. As a brief demo in angular, and follows a bit of the angular tutorial found at : https://angular.io/tutorial

Modal is handled via boostrap. (This could be moved to ng modal)

The customerscomponent class handles a premade list of customer objects and a single customer object that is bound with the modal form, and used to add new customers to the list.

The customercomponent template generates a table of names based on the customercomponent list.
